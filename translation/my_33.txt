3202
I remembered something that happened in the backyard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3203
If anyone learned the information, they'd be jailed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3204
It was public information.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3205
It was very classified.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3206
I did not know how to do the job I was assigned today.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3207
I was told to replace the office fuse box, but I know nothing about electrical wiring.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3208
Today I was asked to perform only duties that I am well trained to perform.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3209
He says he can get it whenever.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3210
He says he would like to get it today.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3211
He says he would like to get the final project by 5pm.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

We moved another time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3214
We never moved after that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

They had been captured at some point but wanted to escape.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3216
They had been detained in relation to a recent robbery.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3217
They were all terrified of being released from custody.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3218
I found it in just a few seconds.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3219
It took me a long time because the book was really thick and confusing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3220
It took me a while to find it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

I had seen Mrs. Faulk a few times but did not know her well.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3225
I was very close friends with Mrs. Faulk.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3226
Mrs. Faulk drove a yellow Honda to work every day.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3227
They left Augusta and went to Atlanta.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3228
They went downtown to the main street.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3229
They went to the street with the most restaurants and bars.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3230
We lived there in the green house.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3231
We lived there many years.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3232
We only lived there two weeks.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3233
I did it without any errors.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3234
I made a mistake when i sent in the forms.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3235
I made a mistake.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3236
He was moody.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3237
My boss was either really happy or really mad.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3238
My boss was mellow and consistent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3239
She had no idea where to look.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3240
She told me the folders would be on the desktop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3241
She told me where to search.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3243
He's much younger than I am.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3244
He's older than me.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3245
I don't know how long it lasts.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3246
I don't know how long the story is running.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3247
I know it's 4 feet long.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3248
I was so happy and relaxed!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3249
I was too anxious to be happy that she had arrived a day earlier.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3250
I was too anxious to be happy that she was there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3251
The mothers are drug addicts.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3252
The mothers aren't on any prescriptions or drugs.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3253
The mothers take drugs.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3254
I do not mind the rain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3255
It is nice and rainy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3256
It is so horrible with the never ending sunshine.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3257
All lives are worth rehab and second chances.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3258
No humans deserve to be rehabilitated.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3259
Regardless of rehabilitation what life is worth it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3260
I've never seen this kind of wiring problem before.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3261
The wiring isn't the issue.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3262
There's a problem caused by this odd wiring.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3263
I'm not at all surprised that they were leinient.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3264
I'm surprised that they let you take food and drinks in there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3265
I'm surprised what they could get away with.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3266
It costs $2000 to buy everything you need.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3267
It costs a lot to outfit yourself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3268
It's really cheap to get outfitted.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

Despite its name, Snake River doesn't actually contain any snakes; it's named for its S-shape.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3270
Snake River has lots of snapping turtles.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3271
Snake River is filled with snakes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3272
I do have a credit union I go to.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3273
I visit my credit union frequently.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3274
What's a credit union?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3275
I think you have to devote 10 hours a day to be good at it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3276
I think you need to be devoted to it to do well.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3277
It's fine if you don't really take it seriously.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3278
I do not need to because my children are over the age of twenty.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3279
I might have to since they are close in age.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3280
I must since they are both ten and eleven years old.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3281
I was born in Fresno.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3282
I'm not sure where this is.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3283
I'm telling you that this is Fresno.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3284
Yeah, people who might not be able to make the best judgment calls.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3285
Yeah, people who might not be hungry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3286
Yeah, people whose decision faculties are never impaired.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

Can you explain how you'd perform aerobics?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3291
I'm interested in aerobics because I need some cardiovascular activity.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3292
Please stop talking about aerobics.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3293
I just know it will be so boring and not worth changing those that represent us so we should not even try to change.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3294
I think it will be challenging to change our representatives but worthwhile in the end.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3295
We have to make changes to those that represent us.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3296
That's a dumb idea I discarded last week.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3297
That's a good point.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3298
The paradox you mention is a good point.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3299
They become hardened and cold once they complete the training.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3300
They change rapidly while undergoing training.
