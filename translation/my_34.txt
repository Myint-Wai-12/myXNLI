When they undergo training they can be quite pleasant.

3302
The day care is open every day for children under the age of five only.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3303
They do let them go more than twice a week if the senior citizens are up to it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3304
They refer to it as a senior day care but it is called the senior center.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3305
I think it's crazy that one lawsuit can go on so many years.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3306
I think it's nuts that it can last so long.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3307
It only lasts a week.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3308
That is what they had been striving for.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3309
That was never what they wanted.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3310
They achieved their goal.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3311
Half of all gun misfires result from single-hand use.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3312
The best way forward for gun control is to use both feet.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3313
Use both hands if you want to practice gun control.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3314
I do not know where it comes from but it is swift.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3315
It comes by fast but I kinda know where it may be coming from.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3316
It comes like molasses and I know exactly when it will be coming.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3317
Correct the one you had was cordless.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3318
The one you had was definitely a corded version only.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3319
You might have had one with an optional cord.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3320
I don't know much about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3321
I'm ignorant in matters of love.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3322
I've been studying it for years.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3323
I think she knows that she was awesome.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3324
No she was horrible.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3325
Yes she was very good.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3326
Are you saying the students or the teacher's aide did it?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3327
Is it the teachers or the parents?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3328
What are you implying about the parents and the teachers?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

The shooting was at least 100 miles from where I live.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3333
The shooting was close to my house and it makes me scared to go outside.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3334
There was a shooting close to my home, it is really not good in this area.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3335
I am thinking of looking at a V6.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3336
I think a V6 is the best way to go.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3337
I would never consider a V6.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3338
I disagree with you, it is very consistent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3339
I think you may be correct about its consistency.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3340
You are correct about it not be consistent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3341
I am strongly against drug testing, there is no doubt in my mind about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3342
I guess I would be fine with being drug tested.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3343
I think so but I have not gone through my emotions with regards to drug testing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3344
I am attempting to hang on.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3345
I really am doing my best.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3346
I will let go and never look back.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3347
Is your puppy a good boy?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3348
What kind of cat did you rescue?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3349
What kind of young dog do you have?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3350
How many children do you have?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3351
I am sorry to hear that you were not able to have children.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3352
You stated you have children, what are their ages?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3353
They may not have been the smartest but they were very friendly and were interested in those that study.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3354
They were really smart but played dumb when around others they did not know very well.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3355
They were the beyond brilliant but detested anyone that put effort into studying.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3356
The skunk was waiting for us to return to the camp site.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3357
We found a goat at the camp site after we had already turned out the lights.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3358
When we came back from an event we found a skunk.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3359
He has learned from the older male children but all of my offspring outshine.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3360
I am very proud of how much my children know.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3361
My kids are truly idiotic.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3362
People constraining the amount of garbage is closer to the issue than the weight of the actual garbage.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3363
People do not need to worry about the amount of garbage as long as they dispose of it properly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3364
People need to consider both the volume and the weight of the garbage they are producing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3365
Concerned about the local places being affected by national news.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3366
I could care less what the national news covers with concerns about our local areas.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3367
The national news outlets make our local places seem backwards.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3368
Do not worry, if there is a mistake I will help take the blame.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3369
If there is an error it belongs to you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3370
If you made a mistake you should take ownership of it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3371
The seams are done in a very skillful way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3373
They took a long time to finish the seams.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3374
Your time keeps increasing every year.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3375
Your time never goes above three days.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3376
Your vacation time increases at the city jobs.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3377
Being in the country makes you live in constant fear of things just like that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3378
What is great about being in the country is you do not have to fret over things like that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3379
What is really swell is in the country you do not have to worry about that like you would in a city.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3380
That seems like either a lot of fun or rrally boring.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3381
That sounds like a great adventure.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3382
That sounds like an awful experience.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3383
I don't dress up when I work at home.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3384
I don't wear anything other than sweats when I work at home.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3385
I still wear dresses when I'm working at home because I feel fancier.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3386
Currently I have a sibling residing in Germany.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3388
I have a sister that speaks German.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3389
I might be able to get my daughter there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3390
It is a little harder for me to get my daughter there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3391
My daughter has her own way to get there now that she can drive.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3392
I hope you have a miserable summer break.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3393
Indeed summer will be here soon.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3394
Yes, have a pleasant summer.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3395
Having a place to live is a dream come true.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3396
I don't really care if i have a place to live.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3397
It's nice to have a place to live.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3398
It would be easy to find out if the corporation was financed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3399
It would make me angry to find out that they had financed the corporation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3400
It wouldn't bother me if the corporation was financed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
