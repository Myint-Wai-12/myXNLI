5301
Some people believed the tale that the princess had been eaten by a dragon.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5302
The ranks of men were dwindling, as everyone headed towards the forecastle for dinner.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5303
The young man looked at it for exactly one minute.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5304
The young man looked at it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5305
The young man's green eyes never looked at it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5306
Adrian wasn't sure if the panicked men would see things differently than Woverstone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5307
He wasn't sure if the panicked men would see things differently than Woverstone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5308
There was no doubt in his mind how the panicked men would see things.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5309
No one on board the ship was shocked in any way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5310
The crew was at war with the people they were yielding to.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5311
The entire crew on the ship was rather shocked at the yield.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5312
It decreased his excitement.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5313
It made him more excited than he had ever been.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5314
It made him more excited.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5315
There was no way of knowing if the boat would still move forward.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5316
There was nothing able to slow down the ship.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5317
We will attempt to battle over it, once we begin to sail.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5318
I might have created the problem in the first place, though I will certainly rescue you all myself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5319
There was no telling how the problem could be easily resolved.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5320
Though the problem was not caused by my own volition, I can rescue you all.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5321
Blood said nothing to the man he encountered.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5322
Blood wished the man a good day.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5323
The man was old.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5324
She did not know why he was addressing her like that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5325
She wanted to know why he had not spoken a single word to her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5326
She was good friends with him, so it hurt her that he spoke to her like that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5327
He is heading into danger right now.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5328
He ran away to avoid getting into danger.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5329
He will head into danger again tomorrow.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5330
The officer never smiled.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5331
The officer smiled for forty minutes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5332
The officer smiled.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5333
A person who is shouting decides to fix someone else's mistake.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5334
His Majesty's Deputy-Governer of Jamaica is already dead.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5335
One man told the other that he had done his work perfectly and that any mistakes were his own fault.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5336
He was generous as he had provided the others with a lot of food.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5337
Sometimes, you can be rather generous he said with a laugh.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5338
You are always so greedy he said with a smirk.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5339
He had made fun of the man.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5340
The gentleman was made fun of because he was not wearing the proper attire for the occasion.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5341
The gentleman was never mocked before.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5342
I was expecting your arrival said the Deputy-Governor.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5343
The Deputy-Governor was not necessarily expecting him, though greeted him anyways.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5344
There was some remorse when the Deputy-Governor had waved hello.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5345
It was unacceptable to have threats, said one to the Captain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5346
The Captain had made a threat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5347
Threats will definitely suffice, Captain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5348
Captain Blood has 20/20 vision.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5349
Captain Blood is blind.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5350
Captain Blood looked at other men before he looked at Ogle.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5351
He didn't have any arms so he asked someone else to point to the girl.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5352
He pointed at the girl.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5353
The girl had blonde hair.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5354
If Ogle were smart, he would have made the Bishop fall in love with him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5355
Ogle was very much in love with the Bishop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5356
Ogle would be a fool if he had hoped to pull on the Bishop's heartstrings.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5357
He had a profound desire to take hold of it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5358
He had chosen to grab it despite it being off-putting to him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5359
He was certainly going crazy at the idea of having to grab it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5360
Ogle never mentioned anyone who disliked the current course.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5361
Some did not like the idea of the current course and refuted it, explicitly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5362
The course was full of territory that was left unexplored and was, therefore, very dangerous.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5363
He never threw anything at me.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5364
He threw them at me 48 times.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5365
He threw them at me over and over.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5366
He was told beforehand of Lord Julian Wade's arrival.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5367
Not a single person was told that Lord Julian Wade was fast approaching.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5368
While there were not many people around, Lord Julian Wade made a grand appearance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5369
Her voice demonstrated a calm and relaxed demeanor.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5370
Her voice provided insight on her worry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5371
She was worried because there might have been a fire.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5372
She considered hiding in either one.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5373
She did not want to betray one so she hid in the other.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5374
She didn't care where she hid.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5375
She had remained silent with her encounter with him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5376
She had screamed out rather loudly which had surprised him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5377
She shouted because the gentleman was thought to be daft.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5378
Captain Calverley didn't have any eyes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5379
Captain Calverley stared at another man.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5380
Captain Calverley stared.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5381
It doesn't matter what I think of you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5382
You might care what I think about you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5383
You should definitely care about what I think of you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5384
They never misunderstood each other.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5385
They were destined to misunderstand each other.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5386
They would always misunderstand each other.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5387
As many said before, Wolverstone was a simple man with few words.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5388
I felt very bubbled by the words of Wolverstone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5389
Wolverstone had said something that did not make one feel bubbled.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5390
Bishop had stains of wine all over himself, as Blood approached him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5391
Colonel Bishop made sure to check his person.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5392
It is likely that nothing will happen to you, said Peter.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5393
The night was considered restful though, there was a lot of commotion later on.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5394
The night was extremely busy as the streets were packed with people.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5395
This evening was busier than usual because of an event being hosted.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5396
Encouraging this, she had found many reasons as to why one would trouble themselves to defend you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5397
She had discouraged any form of defense that was applicable to you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5398
The defense that was put forth by her was insufficient.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5399
I am going to stay here and not go ashore.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5400
I will go ashore in the small boat alone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
