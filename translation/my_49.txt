4801
He chose to take her hands because they were small, delicate, and most of all, clean.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4802
Lord Julian is from St. James's.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4803
She and Lord Julian Wade shared a kiss last night.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4804
She is infatuated with Lord Julian Wade, despite his bumbling nature.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4805
The office screamed for minutes, enraged by the debauchery on his decks.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4806
The officer was confused by what was happening aboard the ship.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4807
The officer was shocked senseless by the vomiting onto the deck.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4808
Lord Julian Wade provided a warm and welcoming greeting.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4809
Lord Julian Wade welcomed others in a manner that would be considered truculent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4810
Though many had tried to approach him, Lord Wade was often cold and emotionless.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4811
Mary Traill can tell you about the donkey.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4812
Mary Traill knows about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4813
Only I know about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4814
Ogle admitted that they had escaped the trap because of her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4815
Ogle had suggested that they get rid of her earlier.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4816
Ogle thought that their ill condition was her fault.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4817
The approaching boat was manned by a dozen sailors.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4818
The boat that was approaching was a tiny one, containing only 3 people.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4819
The scarlet figure in charge of the ship was a woman.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4820
The Spaniards had you, before he delivered you from them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4821
The Spaniards planned to throw you overboard during the night.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4822
You hate him for delivering you from the Spaniards.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4823
He had let Wolverstone go, but he kept the others.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4824
Wolverstone had been kept prisoner for three days.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4825
Wolverstone was not the only person who left.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4826
Blood is an international criminal organization based in Port Royal that Lord Julian contracts with for illicit purposes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4827
Lord Julian's domain includes Port Royal, a trade city that is a hub of activity in the region.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4828
Port Royal has facilities for punishing criminals.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4829
The petticoat is viewed as cursed because they often speak lies.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4830
You are cowardice because of the petticoat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4831
You are quite brave as a result of the petticoat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4832
Someone is asking which way to go.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4833
The questioner is alone and has no one around to confer with.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4834
The questioner is in a hurry and needs to know immediately the route to take.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4835
It was Ogle's second attempt to wrench it free.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4836
Ogle did not stay quiet when he wrenched it free.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4837
Ogle just kept staring at it, without moving.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4838
Granting the King's commission goes against my morals.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4839
I have given hard thought to the King's commission.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4840
I signed the warrant to grant the King's commission without a second thought.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4841
He realized that he had all day to retreat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4842
He realized that he had to make a quick move.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4843
If he stayed in the same place, he would be discovered.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4844
Blood has been very interested in that since September.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4845
Even now Blood didn't have eyes for that
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4846
Even now Blood had no eyes for that because he was busy
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4847
She did not like that he had murdered many men in the past three years.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4848
She spoke happily of his adventures and his personality.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4849
She spoke in sad tones.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4850
Wolverstone had asked a question that demonstrated his assertiveness to others.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4851
Wolverstone had mentioned the Bishop to be one who was very pretty.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4852
Wolverstone never said anything about the Bishop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4853
I assume that this is what your kind do.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4854
I have read about your kind, and their culture.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4855
I take it that this is not common among your kind.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4856
A huge grin was spread on her face.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4857
She felt a sickening feeling in her stomach.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4858
There was a frown on her face.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4859
Blood had a hat that he wore before sitting down.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4860
Blood put on his hat, and left the room without saying anything.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4861
Blood's hat was black, with three eagle feathers on it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4862
Her expression changed after she saw his face.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4863
Her face lit up when she saw the frown on his face.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4864
She did not know if he was angry at her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4865
He slept soundly at night knowing he had rejected the King's commission.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4866
Keeping him up at night was the fact that he accepted the King's commission.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4867
The King's commission was a very prestigious title with many responsibilities.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4868
Ogle said that they were reachable.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4869
Ogle said that they were within earshot.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4870
Though he knew that they were within range, Ogle kept it to himself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4871
I have not heard any news, Captain Blood. Have you?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4872
I received some news before sending for you, Captain Blood.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4873
The news I received shocked me to the core.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4874
Since the great gates were locked, he jumped over the fence, into the courtyard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4875
The great gates were the only entrance to the courtyard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4876
There were big gates that led into the courtyard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4877
Her composure looked unnatural because she had a backache
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4878
She didn't ask anything, she told him to get out.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4879
She was dressed in white when she asked: Why do you run, then?.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4880
Say that I am not looking forward to meeting him there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4881
Say that I look forward to meeting him there this afternoon.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4882
Say that I look forward to meeting him there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4883
He thought someone would be going to the gallows.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4884
He was a sheriff who had captured a thief.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4885
He whispered a way to escape the country in order to avoid jail.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4886
Ogle had a crew.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4887
Ogle let him continue to speak.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4888
Ogle was angry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4889
I believe my uncle wanted to see Captain Blood dead because of his crimes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4890
My uncle left his Barbados plantations before accepting a position in Jamaica.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4891
My uncle used to love Captain Blood and he never left his plantations in Barbados.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4892
I could not bring myself to detain them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4893
I detained them as soon as I saw them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4894
I would not have forgiven myself, if I had detained them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4895
Both Colonel Bishop and Calverly were notified of my coming.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4896
Colonel Bishop and Calverly looked surprised when my name was mentioned.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4897
I rode to the Bishop and Calverly by horseback.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4898
He has never imagined grasping me.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4899
He thinks grabbing me will be really simple.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4900
I may not be as easy to grab as he thinks.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
