901
I see, sir, that you do not yet quite apprehend the circumstances.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

902
I am pressed,  she informed him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

903
As for me,  said Lord Julian, with intent to make Miss Bishop's departure free from all interference on the part of the buccaneers,  I shall remain aboard the Arabella until we reach Port Royal.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

904
Besides, how could their staying have helped me?  And as Pitt did not answer him:  Ye see?  he said, and shrugged.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

905
Then:   You ordered it?  he said in accents of unbelief, whilst Lord Julian raised his eyebrows.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

906
Expressly.   His lordship waited a moment for a reply.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

907
But it'll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

908
I can't think that it would make the least difference if he did,  said his lordship gravely.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

909
You know, Peter, that it is Lord Julian alone has stood between Bishop and his hate of you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

910
But many could not resolve one way or the other until they were satisfied upon several questions, and chiefly upon one which was voiced by Ogle.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

911
Ye're going to deliver yourself into Bishop's hands,  Pitt warned him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

912
Standing beside Captain Blood, he looked astern, following the indication of the Captain's hand, and cried out in his amazement.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

913
He may be right, and he may be wrong.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

914
Your words have rankled with him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

915
But if she resented his tone and his words, she stifled her resentment.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

916
I am informed that yesterday evening a frigate left the harbour having on board your associate Wolverstone and a hundred men of the hundred and fifty that were serving under you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

917
England's,  she corrected him in reproof.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

918
But I suspect this gravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

919
And instantly would have recalled the words had she been able.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

920
But that it was no more than a mask for his fury and his venom was plain to all.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

921
Levasseur?  He smiled a little.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

922
I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of granting the King's commission to such a man as this against all my counsels.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

923
HOSTILITIES   In the great harbour of Port Royal, spacious enough to have given moorings to all the ships of all the navies of the world, the Arabella rode at anchor.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

924
He swung to Lord Julian.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

925
Good-morning to you,  he said, and added  I've blundered badly, so I have.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

926
He stepped back, a baffled, impotent man.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

927
Ah, now, can't ye, indeed?  he cried.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

928
Although even some o' they should know better, for there's still a few was on Barbados with us, and are acquainted like me and you with Colonel Bishop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

929
Pitt, loosely clad in shirt and breeches, leaned against the rail the while and watched him, unmistakable concern imprinted on his fair, frank countenance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

930
That'll be the signal to lie to,  said Blood, in the same listless voice; and he fetched a sigh.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

931
And what better are these?--Are ye afeard of a lubberly Barbados planter? Whatever ails you, Peter? I've never known ye scared afore.   A gun boomed out behind them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

932
And a couple of miles this side of it, bearing after them, came speeding three great white ships.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

933
It's our only chance, I've said, and we must take it.   The better way that was in Captain Blood's mind was the way that already he had proposed to Wolverstone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

934
Some o' them dawcocks may believe that tale.  He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards the men in the waist, whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from the forecastle.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

935
The young master's grey eyes skimmed it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

936
Whether the men in the panic Ogle had aroused among them would take a different view from Wolverstone's he did not know.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

937
Heave her to, and signal to them to send a boat.   A silence of astonishment fell upon the ship--of astonishment and suspicion at this sudden yielding.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

938
If anything it increased his excitement.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

939
Then let them know that if they attempt to hinder our sailing hence, we'll hang the doxy first and fight for it after.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

940
I accept it as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into which my own act may have brought us.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

941
Good-day to you, sir,  Blood hailed him pleasantly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

942
I... I can't think why you should speak to me like this,  she said, with less than her earlier assurance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

943
And the quixotic fool is running into danger at the present moment on our behalf.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

944
A thin, sour smile broke on the officer's haughty lips.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

945
Don't you, by God! And what else do you call this? But as His Majesty's Deputy-Governor of Jamaica, I'll take leave to correct your mistake in my own way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

946
So that ye can be charitable in some ways!  He laughed softly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

947
Hark to the gentleman!  he mocked.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

948
So ye've come,  the Deputy-Governor hailed him, and followed the greeting by a series of grunts of vague but apparently ill-humoured import.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

949
Threats will not serve, Captain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

950
Captain Blood's glance raked the ranks of those resolute, fierce-eyed fellows, then it came to rest again on Ogle.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

951
That girl, there.  He flung out a bare arm to point to her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

952
If ye're counting on pulling Bishop's heartstrings, ye're a bigger fool, Ogle, than I've always thought you was with anything but guns.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

953
He had found the only way, and repellent though it might be to him, he must take it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

954
Aye,  said Ogle,  that is true.   But there were some who were still in open and frank revolt against the course.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

955
He threw them at me again and again.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

956
That is: that he has been notified of the coming of Lord Julian Wade.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

957
Oh, please.  There was real alarm in her voice.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

958
Fearing to betray the latter, she took refuge in the former.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

959
You take that tone! You dare to take that tone!  she cried, astounding him by her sudden vehemence.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

960
You may have heard of me.   Captain Calverley stared hard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

961
What I think of you can be a very little matter to you, sir.   This was a disarming stroke.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

962
It isn't that.   But they were fated to misunderstand each other.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

963
I'll not be bubbled by what Wolverstone has said.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

964
If anything should happen to you, Peter,  he said, as Blood was going over the side,  Colonel Bishop had better look to himself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

965
About him in the waist, where all last night had been so peaceful, there was a frenziedly active bustle of some threescore men.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

966
I cannot think why you should trouble to put yourself on your defence,   she discouraged him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

967
I'll be getting my hat and cane and sword, and go ashore in the cock-boat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

968
I must return to Colonel Bishop for my orders,  he informed them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

969
In a flash Captain Blood saw what was in their minds.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

970
I do my best,  said she.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

971
Oh, but--by your leave--surely there is nothing to be apprehended from Colonel Bishop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

972
I wonder, now,  he said presently,  if the mischief is of your working.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

973
Shrewd advocacy,  he approved it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

974
Bid them take in sail, Jeremy,  he said quietly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

975
I have something to show you.   Wondering, Lord Julian mounted the companion as he was bidden.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

976
Before we've run another half-mile we shall be within range.   Wolverstone swore elaborately, then suddenly checked.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

977
He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

978
He levelled his telescope upon that figure.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

979
Miss Bishop was aboard the Royal Mary also, and I rescued her together with his lordship.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

980
What if he can?  Blood interrupted carelessly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

981
I'll rot in hell or ever I serves the King,  he bawled in a great rage.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

982
Ye're surely daft even to think of it, Peter!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

983
Standing now at the rail, with Lord Julian beside him, Captain Blood explained himself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

984
A boat that had approached unnoticed from the shore came scraping and bumping against the great red hull of the Arabella, and a raucous voice sent up a hailing shout.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

985
You'll not go?  he said, between question and assertion.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

986
Ye'll remember afterwards that it was your hardness drove me.   She moved to depart, then checked, and faced him again.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

987
Faith, you explain yourself after a fashion,  said he.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

988
A drinker of blood, he is.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

989
It's the truth, you fool.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

990
Heave to, Captain, and signal them to send a boat, and assure themselves that Miss is here.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

991
He sought comfort in a line on the open page before him:     levius fit patientia quicquid corrigere est nefas.   Sought it, but hardly found it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

992
For myself, I am entirely of Wolverstone's opinion.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

993
And if ye' weren't a fool, Ogle, you wouldn't need me to tell you this.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

994
See it manned for me.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

995
And what should be happening to me, Jeremy? Sure, now, I'll be back for dinner, so I will.   Blood climbed down into the waiting boat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

996
Just within the doorway of the alley leading to the cabin, he ran into Miss Bishop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

997
Ogle,  said he, in a voice cold and sharp as steel,  your station is on the gun-deck.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

998
He stopped short at sight of Captain Blood, and saluted him, as was his due, but the smile that lifted the officer's stiff mostachios was grimly sardonic.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

999
Yet she had not been coming out, for her back was towards him, and she was moving in the same direction.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

1000
Ha!  Wolverstone vented an ejaculation of sneering mirth.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
