3601
I think I preferred outdoor dogs like the Cocker Spaniel I used to have.

3602
The background check cannot get done that quickly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3603
The background check will take over a month.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3604
They will supposedly do a background check over the next seven days.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3605
Flying would be a lot safer to get there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3606
I can't wait to get off the plane and enjoy myself once we get there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3607
I would never fly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3608
I was wrong that juries are always twelve people.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3609
The jury is always 13 people.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3610
They can pick however many people they want on the jury.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3611
Grand Rapids is a beautiful place.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3612
We don't have a son.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3613
We went to Grand Rapids to see our son graduate.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3614
She didn't care at all about credit unions.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3615
She was interested in credit unions.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3616
She was interested in learning more about how credit unions made their money.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3617
All I see are people sitting and talking about their problems.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3618
Only a few people will actually talk about issues they are having.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3619
People never seem to just sit and talk about their problems and worries.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3620
Did you attend the camp about wilderness?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3621
Did you go to the indoor camp?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3622
I thought you went to the camp.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3623
It is slowly getting worse.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3624
It seems to be getting worse.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3625
It's getting better.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3626
How are you Mary?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3627
How is your day going?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3628
Plano, Texas is an awesome place.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3629
Chaos is all you get from it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3630
It is very calm and doesn't cause any problems.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3631
Some people like the chaos it creates.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3632
I have already seen Darkman about 4 times.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3633
I haven't seen Darkman yet so I decided to get it to watch tonight.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3634
I heard that Darkman was a good movie.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3635
I have been reading since I can remember.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3636
I was an English major so I like reading.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3637
I was an English major that led me to poverty which is why I cannot stand to touch a single novel.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3638
He stole the parrot.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3639
I could not believe he paid $1800 for a parrot.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3640
The parrot was beautiful with multiple colors.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3641
Having a yard is not all fun and games but I do enjoy it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3642
I do not wish to lose it but that is what could happen when you own a yard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3643
When you own your own piece of land you have nothing to lose anymore.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3644
After they tell you what to do, you go ahead and do it yourself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3645
They don't tell you how to do it at all.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3646
They give decent instructions on how to go about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3647
Minorities may have the upper advantage in this case.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3648
Unfortunately, you are stuck being a minority.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3649
You are not a minority.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3650
I like the coverage it has because I never have time to sit and read the paper.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3651
I take at least an hour a day to read the paper just so I dont have to watch it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3652
They cover a lot more than you will get from the paper.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3653
It has nothing to do with anyone involved in the legal system.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3654
It's everyone involved in the legal system.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3655
Most of the legal system is involved, a majority being that of police.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3656
I am not a rap fan but I do like some of the songs they have.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3657
I love rap but their songs are horrible.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3658
They had a few number one hits.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3659
From what I have come across it sounds like accomplishment.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3660
I have gathered from the meeting that things went very well.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3661
I have heard nothing but complaints to be honest.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3662
Testing does take time especially with the construction of building concrete holes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3663
They need to give it time for the concrete to set before beginning any tests.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3664
Time is not needed when building something out of concrete, it dries quick and can be tested right away.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3665
Sometimes it is in house people who assist you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3666
They never use in house people to assist you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3667
You certainly need help if you are trying to handle X amount of dollars.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3668
At the time that I became a member there was at least twenty five hundred individuals.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3669
I think when I joined there was at least a few people that I knew.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3670
There is only at the most one hundred people that ever joined.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3671
I really don't even know what I would pick.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3672
I would choose I'll Fly Away.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3673
I'll Fly Away is my favorite movie and I watch it weekly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3674
The price is pretty good.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3675
We are definitely going to get it to watch our local news.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3676
We don't want it because we like local news and it doesn't get local stations.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3677
After he snapped out of it he seemed to be himself again.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3678
He never snapped out of it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3679
He was only out of it for about 2 minutes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3680
That problem has an easy solution.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3681
There is no problem.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3682
What are you looking for when you shop around for something?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3683
Talking to you has been very annoying.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3684
This has been a nice talk.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3685
We will talk again soon.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3686
Anderson beat out Reagan.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3687
Anderson ran against Reagan as an independent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3688
There were other independent tickets that ran as well.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3689
Even if it is not required it should be done.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3690
It is strange that the state doesn't require it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3691
That makes sense that the state requires it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3692
The are more economical because they are really good on gas.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3693
The gas mileage is terrible and I'm constantly paying for gas.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3694
They are also the best looking cars around.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3695
A couple years ago I studied in London for a semester.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3696
I have never studied abroad before.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3697
London schools are the best.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3698
The did the same thing as everyone else.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3699
Their way of using them was much better.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3700
They did things with them a little differently.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
