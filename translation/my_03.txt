201
So he stayed in Augusta after that?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

202
Her sister's husband was light-skinned too.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

203
Anyway it got up to, we had about uh, ah, I don't remember the numbers.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

204
Anyway, they come up with this invention of the high O2 regulator.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

205
And so, we moved to Las Vegas, NV, and I reported, just like I did in Washington, to a certain address in downtown Las Vegas.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

206
Ah, fourth grade was a lot of fun.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

207
It's like one file with a whole bunch of tabs, of different, you know, each tab has like a different spreadsheet on it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

208
Anyhow, so I finished came home at 6:30 today and that was my day.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

209
I don't care how you get it done.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

210
And so she sat back down, and, you know, they were still chatting, and they could still see this person, and this person was walking really, really fast.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

211
And they moved to Mallard Creek in Charlotte.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

212
And, uh, if it surged and just kept surging it would go 'whish,' and, like it was going to pull your head off.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

213
Where he was a , he was a minister's son, so he had, they had property, and stuff, and they were very well-connected in the community and very, held in high esteem.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

214
I don't have enough information.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

215
And I um, I didn't know how much detail he wanted.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

216
I'll call you back in about an hour, he says.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

217
Of course, they questioned me there, why I went.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

218
And um, it's different, like under each client, is all their files.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

219
It's like more simplified, like the one that she had given me was all detailed and complicated and the second one is all simple.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

220
Cause they didn't actually live in Augusta, they lived in, well you know, Augusta was still a city-town during that time, even though to people in big cities like this Augusta isn't that big.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

221
Late 1962, uh, I got orders to go to Washington, D.C.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

222
When DOT took his property, we moved to a smaller, smaller area in Concord where you are not allowed to have animals because it's zoned and so that's the end of the animal story.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

223
Anyway, we deployed and I can tell now be, because of this that, that, that, uh, we deployed to Kadina, Okinawa, and this was in 1968.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

224
He told me what exactly he needed and that he did need it by today.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

225
She had gone already and she told me just don't worry about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

226
This is just, you know, Look you're in trouble.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

227
My, my mother wound up not being one of his favorites early on and, ah, so she was relegated to working in the fields whereas some of the other kids didn't work in the fields.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

228
And so you know, eventually, you know, you know, they kept asking people around, and nobody knew where they were, and eventually, you know, they just reconciled themselves that they just wouldn't see Joe again.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

229
I told them my sister's.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

230
And she said then her mama, her mama leaned forward, and she looked and she said, Walks like him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

231
I had to start training in course.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

232
you know, and she's stuffing the petals up there and I didn't really know of any consequences.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

233
Well anyway, I went back to my, my desk.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

234
Ah, another thing that happened there that I thought was interesting was one of the first memories of my sister, and that was in that very same backyard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

235
Now that's how classified it was.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

236
So all that stressing and I mean, I had every reason to stress today, it was like, you're giving something you don't know how to do, and it's like here do it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

237
So now, here it is, he wants it today.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

238
And unfortunately we moved again.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

239
They didn't want to stay captive.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

240
So it took me like, an hour to two hours just to find what I needed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

241
Physiological support differs from life support in that he handles the altitude chambers which run pilots up to 80 thousand feet in high altitude chambers, and brings him back down.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

242
I didn't really know Mrs. Faulk very well she was about 80 and, ah, she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

243
And, uh, they moved downtown and, there was, uh, and it's still like this in Augusta, this big street downtown called Broad Street, and it really was just this broad street in a downtown area.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

244
We lived off, um, 85 in Mallard Creek where currently the 485 is now cause then the like last ten years we had to move because of the 485.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

245
That was my messed up.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

246
Boss, he was like with split personality man.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

247
She's like, But you need to look here, look here, she's gives me like three different places to look in the computer.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

248
He's old enough to be my daddy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

249
Everything is linked, and gosh, I don't even know how long.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

250
This time I wasn't even happy that she was there because I was so stressed out.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

251
and that's a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

252
yeah it's real nice has it been raining
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

253
oh what human life is worth and whether or not you can rehabilitate somebody
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

254
oh boy you do have a strange wiring problem there
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

255
sounds like a lot of fun yeah it's amazing to me how how many things they would allow
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

256
yeah exactly i mean by the time you get through outfitting yourself and then having to go sweat doing it uh you could you could go on a Club med uh  everything inclusive vacati on
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

257
oh it was Snake River oh Snake River with a lot of snakes in it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

258
yeah i have a credit union
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

259
exactly it's it's an active state it's not something that you can kind of you know be passively involved in and expect to do any good really i don't think
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

260
oh but anyway anyway um my kids are now twenty one and twenty four so i don't have to
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

261
yeah uh-huh yeah well this is Fresno uh-huh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

262
yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

263
no they're still they're still on tour they've been touring since late sixties
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

264
how would you do aerobics
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

265
and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

266
well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

267
and they can be very nice too after after they've been trained
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

268
day care  two days a week they call it senior citizen day care but she goes to the senior citizen center
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

269
and it can go on for ten twenty years i i think this is a little ridiculous
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

270
that was their goal oh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

271
gun control means using two hands
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

272
and uh but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

273
yeah you you must've had a cordless
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

274
no in fact i'm not even familiar with it i don't think
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

275
yeah she was great you know she
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

276
are you saying the teachers or the parents
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

277
yeah he suggested just getting uh um a uh um a mop like you would use
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

278
its really bad out here we just had a freeway shooting about three blocks from our house
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

279
besides i probably would look at something uh maybe a a V six
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

280
uh-huh that's true it is it's not really uh consistent
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

281
well i guess it would i guess so well i don't know i i i really haven't sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing uh i'm totally straight would never consider using drugs
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

282
i'm trying to hang in there
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

283
yes oh what sort of puppy do you have
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

284
well you said you have kids how old
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

285
they probably weren't the most brilliant people in the world but they uh were very personable and took uh a interest in people who were willing to study
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

286
one time we did go that thing uh there we came back from an event and turned the lights on around the camp site and there's a skunk right
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

287
you know all my children excel they're they're really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

288
and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

289
care about how the national news affects the local area
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

290
so if there's a mistake it's your mistake i guess
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

291
you know especially making the seams and things like that you know it's it's got such a professional finish on them
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

292
yeah yeah my place you get two weeks when you start and then every every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

293
uh that's what's nice about living more in the country you don't have to worry about any of that
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

294
oh oh my word well that sounds adventuresome
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

295
but no we usually you know skirt and skirt and blouse or suit or dress is is what you see down here so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

296
