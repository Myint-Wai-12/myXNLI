5401
I will go ashore in the small boat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5402
He said that he didn't have to go to Colonel Bishop to get orders.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5403
He told them he would go to Colonel Bishop for his orders.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5404
He told them he would go to Colonel Bishop tomorrow for his orders.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5405
Captain Blood hastily read what the other people were thinking.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5406
Captain Blood, for the life of him, could not figure out what was on their minds.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5407
It is true that Captain Blood knew how to read people from taking Psychology back at his university.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5408
She said that she does her best only on Fridays.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5409
She said that she does her best.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5410
She said that she never does her best.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5411
Colonel Bishop likely did not have anything to obtain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5412
Colonel Bishop said something that was to be apprehended with utmost disgust.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5413
The Bishop was supposed to apprehend a criminal.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5414
He never questioned whether the mischief was your doing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5415
He questioned whether or not if the mischievous acts were caused by you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5416
The source of the mischief was not yours alone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5417
He had approved the shrewd advocacy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5418
He most certainly did not approve of the shrewd advocacy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5419
He only approved it because it was the right thing to do at the time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5420
He spoke with a soft tone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5421
Jeremy shouted very loudly to get their attention.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5422
Jeremy was a pirate for his entire life.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5423
Julian got off his mount as he told him that he had nothing to show.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5424
Lord Julian had ridden his companion.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5425
The companion of Lord Julian was a horse.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5426
Remaining silent, Wolverstone realized that it was impossible for them to get into range.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5427
Wolverstone attempted to captain his ship and was really close to another battle.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5428
Wolverstone let out a curse as they realized that there was another half-mile before they were in range.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5429
Even women think that he over-does his chivalry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5430
He certainly goes overboard with his chivalry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5431
He needs to learn to be a little more chivalrous.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5432
He aimed his telescope at the figure in the morning.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5433
He aimed his telescope at the figure.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5434
He broke his telescope and therefore couldn't look at anything with it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5435
I also rescued 15 other people.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5436
I rescued Miss Bishop and his lordship together.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5437
Miss Bishop rescued me and his lordship.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5438
Blood was asking because he was very intent on doing things his way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5439
Blood, without care, asked if he could.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5440
But what if he can not? asked Blood, politely.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5441
I might serve the king, but I won't be happy about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5442
I will happily serve the king!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5443
I will never serve the king!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5444
Peter had an idea so genius that anyone would agree.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5445
Peter thought he could survive jumping off of a 3 story building.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5446
Peter was having a thought that seemed ignorant.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5447
Captain Blood and Lord Julian stood forty feet apart.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5448
Captain Blood stood with Lord Julian next to him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5449
Lord Julian was stading on Captain Blood's right.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5450
As the boat collided with the Arabella, there was a loud sound.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5451
The Arabella is a boat with a red exterior.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5452
The boat had purposefully collided with the Arabella knowing it was there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5453
Are you not going? He asked.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5454
Please do not go! He begged.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5455
Why are you not leaving right now? He grunted.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5456
She had turned towards him despite motioning to leave.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5457
She quickly ran away from him, never to face him again.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5458
Though offended, she had turned towards him to say one last goodbye.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5459
An explanation is offered right away.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5460
He said that an explanation is offered after some time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5461
While it takes some time, there is always an explanation given.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5462
He drinks blood.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5463
He has never consumed blood.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5464
He only drinks women's blood.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5465
Everything I say is true.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5466
It is absolutely false.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5467
It is true.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5468
As the Miss never showed up, there was no need to call in the boat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5469
Miss had arrived rather early and as a result, the boat had yet to come ashore.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5470
The Miss had finally arrived leaving only a need to signal the boat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5471
He found little safety through reading the passage on the page.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5472
The language described in the pages are of a language native to the land.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5473
There was some foreign language in the pages before him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5474
I admit that I have disagreed with Wolverstone before.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5475
I completely side with Wolverstone on this matter.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5476
I have never heard of a person called Wolverstone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5477
Ogle appears to be rather foolish, as one claimed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5478
Ogle was foolish in believing in the existence of Santa Claus.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5479
One said that Ogle was certainly the smartest man he had ever met.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5480
It should be controlled by someone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5481
See that no one mans it for me.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5482
The boat's cannons were currently unmanned.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5483
Blood got into a bathtub and sailed away.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5484
Blood got into a boat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5485
Blood got into a purple boat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5486
He encountered Miss Bishop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5487
He never encountered Miss Bishop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5488
Miss Bishop was wearing red shoes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5489
He told Ogle that his station is always in the galley.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5490
He told Ogle that his station is on the gun-deck.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5491
Ogle is always stationed on the gun-deck.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5492
Captain Blood was nowhere to be found.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5493
He could see Captain Blood.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5494
The officer had a mustache.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5495
Never once did she turn around to look at him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5496
She was walking towards him, coming to a halt once near.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5497
She went ahead of him by walking in the same direction.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5498
Wolverstone did not laugh.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5499
Wolverstone laughed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5500
Wolverstone thought that was funny.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
