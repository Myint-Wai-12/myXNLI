I don't believe he wants to be in that position.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3705
I don't think he wants to be king.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

I knew instantly that the name was Piece of Parliament.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3714
I often have trouble recalling names on the spot.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3715
The name escaped me at first but it is referred to as the Peace of Parliament.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3716
I am not able to use the cakes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3717

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3718
I wish I could do something with the cakes but I have no use for them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3719
It's an automatic weapon made out of plastic.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3720
It's more durable than a metal weapon.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3721
The weapon is made from cardboard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

The crowd is always dressed pretty casually.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3726
The crowd likes to get dressed up.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3727
Their clothes are very stylish.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3728
I get along better with my girlfriend's daughter pretty well compared to my girlfriend.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3729
I have to take my girlfriend's daughter shopping for clothing before the school year starts each year.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3730
My girlfriend's daughter refuses to go shopping with me.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

really like books by PJ O'Rourke .
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

I think it is close to twenty minutes but I'm not positive.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3735
It is approximately twenty minutes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3736
It is exactly ten minutes long.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3737
It is pretty close to what I mean.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3738
No, that is not true at all.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3739
Yes, that is the truth.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3740
It is astounding how a little can produce a lot.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3741
People love finding out how much they can get out of so little.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3742
There is no way that so little would be enough.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3743
I knew ahead of time that someone would die and that it would be depressing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3744
I was hoping that it would have some lighthearted moments.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3745
I was not expecting anyone to die.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3746
Of course, getting out of each other's way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3747
Yes getting in the way of each other.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3748
Yes, it could be seen as a barrier to each other.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

There were a lot of people attending the satellite seminar.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3758
It holds a lot more plants than you would think.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3759
It is ridiculous that you can hardly fit any plants in there at all.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3760
The number of plants it can hold depends upon the types of plants you put in.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3761
I watched Dances with Wolves.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

I've never seen a Kevin Costner movie.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3764
It's much cheaper to live here than any other state.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3765
It's not that expensive to live here.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3766
This is the most expensive place you can live!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3767
I believe it was out in the country.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3768
I believe the new house is way out in the country, miles from anything.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3769
It's right in the middle of the city.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3770
I wish that this did not have to happen since it was so discouraging.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3771
Yeah it made it without a single scratch!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3772
Yes is have surely gone through a lot.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3782
I do not like to go when something is released the night of but rather wait a week to see it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3783
I was there on opening night of course!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3784
It was a great time especially since it was a week after it was released.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3785
I bet you taught yourself how to do that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3786
That is so lame, I am glad you dont know how to do it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3787
Where did you learn how to do that?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3788
Some stores carry exercise equipment.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3789
Some stores have yoga mats and training guides.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3790
You have to order exercise stuff online, since no stores carry it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3791
Both of these options should pay well over normal market rate over the next decade.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3792
Eventually this position should have much better salary options than the alternative.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3793
We should be able to offer similar salary options eventually.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3794
This empowers people and makes them feel great about things!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3795
This is just making people feel bad and guilty.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3796
This is making people donate more than they can afford, just because they feel bad for the poor people.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3797
We don't have any holidays at all!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
