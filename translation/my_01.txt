1
And he said, Mama, I'm home.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

2
Well, I wasn't even thinking about that, but I was so frustrated, and, I ended up talking to him again.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3
And I thought that was a privilege, and it's still, it's still, I was the only nine two-two Ex-O which was my AFFC Air Force Career field.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4
They told me that, uh, that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5
There's so much you could talk about on that I'll just skip that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

6
I didn't know what I was going for or anything, so was to report to a designated place in Washington.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

7
That was the primary thing we wanted to save since there wasn't any way to dump a 20-megaton H-bomb off a 30, a C124.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

8
He didn't get to go.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

9
And I was like OK, and that was it!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

10
So I'm not really sure why.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

11
I was just there just trying to figure it out.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

12
This is Fannie Flono, and she grew up in Ag-- Augusta, GA, and she is going to talk about some stories from her childhood.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

13
And, uh, they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just, just determined that they were going to be white.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

14
And I had put uh, five detachments out of U2's.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

15
I was the only one that uh, ever run the regulators for the, the test in the miniature altitude chambers.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

16
I'm uh, Chief Master Sergeant, retired, as Rick said.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

17
And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sister's husband decided that they were going to move to the city, to Augusta, and pass for white.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

18
There's some cash flow projections on my desk and, um, uh, it's for such and such Cutty, that's the client's name.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

19
The girl that can help me is all the way across town.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

20
Michael Santo of, of Firewell and Company, of Buffalo, NY, they was the one that uh, manufactured, uh, invented the high O2 regulator before that they built fire control on the stove well.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

21
But they were divided about like who were the field hands and who were the house kids, it was kind of--
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

22
But he was, you know, in a lot of ways, just like a plantation owner's son because he was the son of this guy who owned a lot of property.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

23
Today he is going to talk to us about the Third SS, the U2 Quick and the Blackbird.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

24
I mean they only had, like, they had five children, one of them died.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

25
And, of course, Androv Gromikov didn't answer anything, but we had all the information from the films the U2 had taken.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

26
She said there were just tears coming down from her eyes and she said, then she said Joe came up on the porch.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

27
Even if the aircraft was on fire, why it, it would uh, burn and it would melt through a lead component for the radiation to leak out.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

28
But my job was to put parachutes on it and life preservers when we would load it and start to an overseas location.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

29
Now that's how, uh, I stay buckled in.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

30
This is Chief Master Sergeant Clem Francis, retired from the US Air Force.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

31
Well it got to where there's two or three aircraft arrive in a week and I didn't know where they're flying to.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

32
They had already had their training in the full pressure suits and it taken me a while if you go into full pressure suits.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

33
And he was a philanderer, an d oh yeah, he was like out there . And, ah, so, you know, I didn't like him, but anyway those are my stories.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

34
When I pull, when he pulls the canopy for me to start getting him out, he points to two instruments on the left side of the aircraft that had actually melted during the flight.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

35
And, she didn't really understand.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

36
I want to say that there wasn't any danger of going in with the bomb because it would not explode, regardless of how hard it hit the ground.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

37
And how about it looks like exactly what I'm trying to do.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

38
But anyway, the animals would get loose all the time, especially the goats.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

39
Maybe she told everyone else and I wasn't paying attention at that particular time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

40
The doors were locked when we went in.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

41
Only lost two, three aircraft while we was there, and, uh, test phase.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

42
I need you to do something for me.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

43
So I just had to take the totals and try and figure it like that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

44
He came, he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face, and I could tell that he was disappointed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

45
So, I don't have any specific stories.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

46
Different, totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies, uh, three times the speed of sound, over 22,000 miles an hour.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

47
It was, uh, which we, uh, had Rudolph Anderson in a, a formulation of three U2's.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

48
And it was, he never really had to do anything for himself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

49
She was still in there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

50
So I'm like, Oh my gosh, and Ramona was standing there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

51
Also, oh, let me go through this.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

52
And the fact is she was light!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

53
But all of a sudden, we was called out to look at what was flying.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

54
He would tear the, the paper up and put it in the sand, ashtray sand, set it on a fire and burn it, and then stir the ashes up like that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

55
I don't know whether he stayed in Augusta after that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

56
All we done, they never did tell us any place where they was going, even when they left the base to go to somewhere else to stay for a while.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

57
Um, You need to call Ramona at Concord, mind you she's at an office, actually she's in a client, all the way across town, we're in Monroe, she's in Concord.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

58
That's kind of unique in that I, uh, spent, uh, about 16 years of my career in Special Activities.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

59
They said, We're paying for a place for you to stay.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

60
Well, the next day, of course, President Kennedy, uh, blockaded Cuba, and, uh, our ships stopped a Russian ship that was headed just outside of Cuba within, and they found missiles on them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

61
Anyhow the man comes in.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

62
Um, my grandparents were always very, very loving people and some of, my parents were and we'd just have a great time down there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

63
I think that's why I remember that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

64
And it makes you feel just awful.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

65
You don't have to stay there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

66
I didn't have time to enter in all kinds of whatever.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

67
And, uh, one of my jobs at the time was training individuals how to put parachutes on a nuclear weapons trigger to, uh, which detonates the atomic bomb itself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

68
My grandmother used to tell me a lot of different stories about her growing-up years and, uh, especially, uh, she used to talk about her family, and what it was like during those times.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

69
We had full pressure suits there in the aircraft just, just like the astronauts wore, except ours was totally silver, silver uh, boot and everything, to reflect heat, of course.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

70
And he was, my grandfather was not a nice man.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

71
It's 30 or 40 U2 aircraft, and we'd started the training Chinese pilots, British pilots in them, just all over the, the world that we were allies with.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

72
So, she's like, Well look, look up this in such and such company.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

73
He said that they had gone up North.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

74
That was, that was a pretty scary day.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

75
Uh, well it's, uh, the speeds got faster, faster, and faster until we deployed overseas.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

76
So, well I, uh, anyway, uh, uh, this is the three, uh, U2 pilots that, uh, President Kennedy's office in Washington with General May.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

77
Before you give me a spanking, why don't you just let me have one big glass of chocolate milk first?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

78
And then once you get everything entered you can go on from there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

79
Um, no, to be honest, I never read any of the books I was supposed to.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

80
I go ahead and picked the baggage and went to the address I was supposed to.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

81
It was an amazing mood swing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

82
They've, they chosen me over about 15 individuals there, to go to through that school and I'm not, I'm not.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

83
They have to go through a number of altitude chambers, uh, rides before they start even flying U2's or flying with pressure suits.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

84
But uh, think about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

85
I'm covering the same stuff.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

86
This was the first time that, that had happened in 75 years, that TX legislature had voted a military unit being TX Ambassadors, so, needed TX Ambassadors.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

87
If there was anything I could do.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

88
She hated that, and she used to tell her sister every day, she said that, that You are doing wrong.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

89
They took Joe with them, and my Granny said, she said it was such a sad time in the house because, you know, everybody was missing Joe and they didn't know what to do.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

90
So I went to her house and then I called in to this number I was supposed to call when I got there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

91
Well I get there this morning and um, I forget how, I think either I asked a question and he came in there or, whatever.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

92
We didn't know where they were going.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

93
But I was like, forget it, I'm going to eat lunch I was hungry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

94
The part was, there was 158 parts to it and we had to break it down put it back together break it down and never make a mistake.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

95
So and let me tell you I got to the point today where I was about to quit.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

96
I don't want to go into the Third SS that's Third Strategic Support Squadron.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

97
It wasn't nothing but a desert; there was sagebrush out on the runway.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

98
He was born in 1880 something, like 188, I think it was 1889, I think it was when he was born.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

99
You'd better get the little screw turned down a little bit because you could damage and individual's lungs very easily.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

100
I got orders to go to Del Rio, TX, so when I arrived out there, well, I found out I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
