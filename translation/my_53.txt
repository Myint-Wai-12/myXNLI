5201
He completely and quite clearly, understood the situation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5202
He did not understand the circumstances because he was ignorant of all the facts.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5203
I do not believe you understand the entirety of the situation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5204
She had told him that she was pressured.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5205
She was feeling relaxed, as she relayed to him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5206
She was pressed because she had many deadlines coming soon.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5207
Lord Julian got off the Arabella as soon as he possibly could, leaving Miss Bishop alone.

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5209
Lord Julian was very interested in Miss Bishop, one may say he fancied her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5210
He had moved his shoulders in a sign of acceptance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5211
He told them that he could see it but it was not a big deal in the end.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5212
It was clear that staying could have helped me, so no question was ever posed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5213
He spoke and Lord Julian raised his lion.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5214
He was speaking in a Russian accent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5215
His accents were unbelievable when he spoke.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5216
His lordship had replied after a little bit of time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5217
The lord was only taking his time because he needed to think of a witty response.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5218
The lordship replied immediately and only figuratively.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5219
He wants to see you about the Old Bear and not about the Old Wolf.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5220
He wants to see you about the Old Wolf.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5221
He wants to see you today about the Old Wolf.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5222
His choice was between buying 12 chickens or 3 oxen.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5223
His lordship believed that either choice would have had a substantial impact.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5224
Whether or not he chose to act, his lordship did not believe it would have changed anything.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5225

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5227

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

Ogle had many concerns, of which had yet to be satiated.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5230

5231
Bishop was a sinister individual with no mercy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5232
Pitt did not say anything to them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5233
Pitt had altered the other that they would likely be playing into Bishop's plans.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5234
Captain Blood was notoriously good at promoting morale.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5235
He looked rather sad and remained quiet beside the Captain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5236
He shouted in shock as he stooped beside the Captain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5237
He is absolutely neither right nor wrong.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5238
He is both right and wrong.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5239
He might be right, and he might be wrong.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5240
He did not like what you said.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5241
He is going to punish you for those words.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5242
He really enjoyed what you said.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5243
He had acted rather terrible to her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5244
She had hidden the fact that she may have resented how he acted.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5245
She loved the words in which he spoke to her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5246

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5248
All of the men were under six feet tall.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5249
He was wrong and she said nothing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5250
She fixed his issue.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5251
She was always tasked with correcting him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5252
Julian looked serious but was actually amused.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5253
Julian thought the situation was funny.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5254
Julian was being clear about his feelings.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5255
She also would have remembered the music if she had been able.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5256
She would have remembered the words if she had been able.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5257
She wouldn't have recalled anything, even if she had been able.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5258
He attempted to hide a villainous face with a less sinister facade.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5259
He had nothing to hide and provided an appearance that was genuine.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5260
His toxicity came from a painful upbringing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5261
He didn't smile at all.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5262
He kept his mouth closed as he smiled a bit.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5263
He smiled a bit.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5264
The lordship just took my advice and carried his acts accordingly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5265
While the lordship was very smart, his grave mistake of not listening to my counsel will spell the end of the kingdom.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5266
Your lordship has chosen to act in a manner against my advice.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5267
The Arabella often took on only the finest of crew members.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5268
The Arabella was no where to be seen in the Port Royal harbor as it was too small to fit the large ship.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5269

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5272

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5273
Good-evening to you, he mentioned to him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5274
He had said good morning to him out of respect.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5275
He had wished him a good morning.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5276
He was not affected at all.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5277
He was shocked and taken aback.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5278
His reaction showed that he was deeply hurt.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5279
He asked because he was rather shocked about the whole situation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5280
He had shouted a question.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5281
He never posed a question as he remained silent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5282
Neither one of us knows Colonel Bishop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5289
Blood was engaged in a high-stakes poker game.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5290
He had given off a sigh as Blood mentioned something about a signal.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5291
I always knew you were easily scared, Peter.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5292
I had never known Peter to be scared.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5293
They heard the gunshot and knew it was headed in their direction.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5297
Captain Blood had never spoken to Wolverstone before.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5298

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5299
The opportunity was then and now.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
