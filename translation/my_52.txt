5101
There is a way that is safe and easy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5102
She quickly fled the scene in order to avoid further scrutiny.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5103
The fact that she was here after the fight with Wolverstone was considered an embarrassment.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5104
Wolverstone never got into a dispute with her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5105
It had completely halted the gunner's intent to do anything.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5106
The gunner had an intent to do something.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5107
The gunner had intended to fire his weapon.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5108
As he tried to think, Blood remained indecisive.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5109
Blood had decided that he wanted eggs for breakfast.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5110
Blood had quickly come to a conclusion about his situation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5111
I haven't spoken to his lordship in ages.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5112
I spoke to his lordship just now.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5113
I was in love with Miss Bishop as well.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5114
Lord Julian dressed hurriedly in his cabin.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5115
Lord Julian put on a clown suit in his cabin.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5116
Lord Julian stayed naked in bed in his cabin.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5117
He had suddenly asked a question as to who you may be.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5118
He quietly murmured to himself the whole time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5119
The person was actually the devil himself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5120
As the lordship, he showed no mercy to his subjects.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5121
His lordship spoke calmly to all giving the impression of a warm and gentle person.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5122
The Lord's voice felt both distant and chilling
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5123
Captain Blood was recently promoted to his position because of the work he had done.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5124
Perforce Bishop did not put on a strong appearance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5125
Perforce Bishop was to command alongside the Captain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5126
As he is experienced, Captain Blood helped boost morale amongst his crew members.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5127
Captain Blood yelled to Old Wolf.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5128
Let go! Captain Blood yelled to Old Wolf.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5129
He has only one eye.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5130
He has three eyes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5131
He only has a left eye.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5132
The blood came from a person's eye as they had looked into the telescope.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5133
There was blood around the telescope.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5134
There was no sign of blood anywhere near the telescope.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5135
The matter had been resolved.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5136
The matter remains unresolved.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5137
The solution to the matter was more or less there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5138
I want you to explain yourself! I know you know where Wolverstone is.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5139
Wolverstone is right here. No explanation needed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5140
You should explain yourself! What happened to Wolverstone?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5141
Pitt and the gunner were both excited because they had just made a huge success.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5142
The gunner was feeling giddy as Pitt went beside him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5143
The gunner was feeling grim as Pitt approached him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5144
Blood had walked right past the helmsman, ignoring him entirely.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5145
Blood wanted to talk to the helmsman to figure out when they would eat together.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5146
There was a fair young man who happened to be the helmsman.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5147
The country is merely a part of the whole, sir.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5148
The country is not a sovereign one.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5149
Years of chaos has rendered the land unstable.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5150
He had armed himself as he was about to enter a more dangerous part of town.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5151
He had lost his gun and did not have it on his person.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5152
He had put a gun right on himself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5153
Ogle had attempted to give orders as though he were the Captain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5154
The Captain of the ship was feeling rather ill.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5155
There was no one on the ship to give orders.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5156
Finally, it had provided him with some grievance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5157
It did not provide to him, any grievances in the least.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5158
The death of a family member had brought him much sadness.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5159
Blood allowed the gunner to carry on with what he had to say.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5160
Blood had put his hand up against the gunner's arm in an attempt to hold him back.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5161
Blood needed to speak privately to the gunner.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5162
The ship will sink unless the crew acts fast.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5163
There is a way for them to sink.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5164
They can not possibly sink in any circumstance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5165
He was feeling very worried because he had forgotten something rather important.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5166
His composure remained steadfast as his heart filled with relief.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5167
His heart was mostly filled with anxiety as his composure broke.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5168
The Wolverstone completely haulted.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5169
The Wolverstone did not come to an end.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5170
The Wolverstone was part of an elaborate ploy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5171
He never desired to be anything like that dog in that one fable.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5172
The fable is as old as time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5173
There was once a story about a dog and a delusive shadow.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5174
There might have been an error to give Captain Blood his commission.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5175
There was no mistake in providing Captain Blood with his commission.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5176
There was the potential for error as the accountant was recently fired.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5177
Right passed the both of them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5178
The bullet went cleanly through both participants.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5179
Through the both of them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5180
His hand had been forcibly held by the Bishop's nieces at all times.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5181
His hand was not held by the Bishop's nieces.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5182
They would only hold his hand in times of great stress.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5183
He certainly is unable to show this.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5184
He might be able to demonstrate this.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5185
He needed to show off his skills.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5186
This was not what we were informed on.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5187
We were told this.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5188
When being told what to do, management failed to let us in on the trade secrets.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5189
She asked how because it had seemed impossible from her perspective.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5190
She never took interest in the talk and asked no questions.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5191
She was suddenly interested in the conversation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5192
She was calm and collected, giving off no signs of impatience or worry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5193
She was out of breath and looking flustered for a moment.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5194
The lady was anxious because she was in love.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5195
He lowered his voice to a whisper.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5196
He raised his voice so high that it could be heard for miles around.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5197
He raised his voice.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5198
His name was not Wade but instead, Smith.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5199
Julian Wade was given his lordship by right of birth.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5200
Lord Julian Wade was his name.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
