<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

409
yeah they get crowded real quick the crowd's a little dressier too more of a yuppie crowd
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

410
well i have a girlfriend who has a daughter that's a teenager and every year before school starts she has me take her shopping for clothes because they fight too much
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

411
you know yeah well i i went to the library yesterday looking around and i found this uh new book by PJ O'Rourke called uh uh Parliament of Horrors and it's about uh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

412
it's um about twenty minutes
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

413
yeah that's true but  but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

414
uh it's amazing it's amazing what you can get out of a little
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

415
and uh it was just really good i knew it was going to be sad and i knew somebody was going to be dying
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

416
get in each other's way yeah
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

417
well i have a VCR and i've had to return it a couple of times because of the same part failure and uh it's still not getting a real good picture
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

418
yeah well i in fact i had older singers so or older older singers older sisters
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

419
huh well that's neat well um it was real funny i went to a seminar that was just it was is a satellite seminar it was really neat and it was just for women
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

420
you know it's probably about twenty by i don't know twenty by six something like that and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

421
uh Dances With Wolves we just saw that kind of late what else have i seen uh Silence of the Lambs
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

422
but it's a it's a type of area we live in of course living expenses aren't as bad either though which makes a difference
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

423
i don't know though but i still think like out in the country when she said that i was like what
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

424
yeah because it's uh it had definitely been through the mill but uh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

425
uh no i never organized one but we're we have one uh we're going to have one on Memorial Day i guess they've had one the last two years
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

426
uh-huh yours is a four door
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

427
yeah there you you know usually there's uh i have a a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

428
it was was a lot of fun yeah it was um  real popular obviously it was about a week after it'd come out i think
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

429
well oh well that's interesting do you uh did you take classes to learn how to do that
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

430
no problem at all and uh if you get one of these mats you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these ABCs of physical fitness on them
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

431
and uh i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

432
where and um there'd be more honest settlements instead of this um uh tugging of people's heart strings and um making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

433
uh we get we get uh New Years Day Good Friday Memorial Day July Fourth Labor Day uh Thanksgiving and the day after and then Christmas and a day either side of it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

434
that's right we might come up short next year if we haven't spent everything this year and so no matter how foolish the expenditure be sure we get rid of that money
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

435
with the others we've either with some friends done a a sort of Mother's Day out kind of thing where they took turns
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

436
right well most most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

437
oh yeah yeah that's a great place to visit that really is yeah
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

438
yeah i like those movies that you watch time and time again
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

439
and given given that knowledge and stuff with it and he seems to enjoy it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

440
the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check you know and it's unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but it's almost that attitude
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

441
do we know what we're going to say
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

442
yeah they weren't course they weren't talking about uh where you know you're absolutely unable to care for them but it was it you know they would come from large extended families
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

443
oh yeah some people think they're predicting that he'll make a big comeback
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

444
and let's see twenty years ago i guess we're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the uh the sex revolution where uh after the pill and uh uh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

445
uh-huh all right bye now
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

446
probably and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

447
i don't usually i just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i'll never take the time to do it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

448
okay and do they have good lasagna
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

449
it's just that since my money is tight right now i don't even give myself a tempting
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

450
i think just one is all you need
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

451
yeah i i just um heard of him this year my boyfriend um he uh likes some types of country music and he was listening to that and it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

452
yeah some special interest group
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

453
well nice talking to you thanks a lot bye bye
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

454
um there's nothing wrong with a parent gifting everything she has to uh to uh to an individual like uh like like you
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

455
spend it on the ones who who do have a chance
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

456
so if we have the opportunity just because it's quieter
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

457
yeah i'll probably try to go see
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

458
Texas only had fifty five thousand when i was there
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

459
so i want to keep at it because i know that if you don't uh there's there's lots of problems that you can have
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

460
expensive you can get a lot of money in that kind of stuff especially the good stuff
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

461
and uh so it's a giant plastics plant i think they have a seventy like a seventy five percent market share or something
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

462
when i was growing up uh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

463
they don't have snow they don't know what snow is they freak out when there's snow on the ground  oh Amarillo well that's close to here how long have you been in Raleigh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

464
excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

465
well well not not even lately tell me
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

466
huh-uh uh not downhill we do have cross country skies and
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

467
um hum yeah so so so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

468
so i don't know wish i did
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

469
uh-huh well then you just pay it off at the end of the month
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

470
yeah we have between the spouse and myself we have six
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

471
well i don't have kids so it's kind of hard to say
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

472
yes well it it's not it's not legal to carry a handgun in Texas but no it's not you can have it in your home
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

473
well i'm in Texas and we have a teacher that died from AIDS
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

474
yeah and anytime you try to walk down the uh the ushers would always tell you to go back
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

475
yeah well her name's Sam because it's like short for Samantha and everybody calls her him
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

476
mine are too but i think it's a real real a real serious situation for a lot of people
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

477
oh and then if you try to get it outside of your uh corporation you're gonna pay an arm and a leg
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

478
i'm looking forward to it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

479
um well i sort of own a computer we have two PCs at home but neither one do we really own um both are no both of them are sort of work related and
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

480
and uh sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

481
i i can't remember i've only done this one other time
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

482
all that so there's a lot of things like that that Texas Instruments makes that even the employees don't know they make  for the most part
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

483
it's real real dangerous i i would think but with all the accidents
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

484
and uh so i really enjoyed that
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

485
uh that's yeah i'd like to see them restrict just those like i said before those new automatic weapons but the rest of it i don't think they need anymore
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

486
yeah that's another thing i don't understand is is is things like selling technology and uh even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

487
uh-huh you don't feel as though that that's a decision you're comfortable with because
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

488
well it seems to me that that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

489
uh well computer science and cognitive science so
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

490
wow maybe i should go see it in a theatre and plan to go out to dinner afterwards so we could sit and talk about it
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

491
and they just pretty much know how much they have coming in you know and they just make sure they don't buy over
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

492
is it we have almost an acre yeah it's it's funny because we have um
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

493
well we're definitely keeping them poor and down trodden and helpless
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

494
uh you know they'll be gone and and uh there won't be as many activities do you uh
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

495
it's kind of like a soap a nighttime soap opera type thing
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

496
yeah i always said if i died well i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog  that'd be the best way to be
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

497
um-hum well and i was gonna say there are some other areas they could cut you know i don't they wouldn't necessarily have to cut it out of there
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

498
yeah well lately about my only halfway experience with camping is we uh my husband races cars
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

499
but aside from that i hope it's still warm not too cold maybe maybe maybe well maybe a little snow on Christmas Eve or something would be nice but it doesn't look good
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

500
the latest contract that was awarded Virginia sued or has got a lawsuit against uh Gratin to stop construction because it was unfairly obtained or something like that you know
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
