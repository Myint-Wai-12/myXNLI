4901
Blood was grumpy because he hadn't had anything to eat.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4902
Ogle didn't meet with any opposition when he was progressing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4903
Ogle's advancement was blocked by blood, who looked sternly at him while he met him with argumentative intent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4904
I accept it willingly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4905
I am not willing to accept it, but I could be convinced.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4906
I don't accept it willingly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4907
After a pause he said a murderer, I.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4908
He hadn't murdered anyone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4909
Immediately he said, A murderer, I.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4910
I have been following him closely for a year without him knowing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4911
I have only been following him for close to a week.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4912
Over the course of the past year I have been stalking him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

His lordship told her that ships came from the Jamaica fleet.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4917
The ships of the Jamaica fleet impressed her, that's why she asked about them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4918
They are ships of the American fleet, his lordship answered her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4919
He liked the girl so he put himself in a bad position.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4920
He placed himself in a position for a girl that didn't pay attention to him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4921
He put himself in his current position for a girl that was obsessed with him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4922
You are definitely wrong.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4923
You may be right about several situations, but you may be wrong too.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4924
You may be wrong but it's possible that you're right
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4925
I'm sure you didn't grant the King's commission to this man, he said cheerfully.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4926
His tone denounced the bitterness of his resentment.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4927
You have granted, I am told, the King's commission to the man because of his bravery.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4928
She was blue and she kept her eyes closed all the time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4929
She was very pale and she kept her eyes on her hands.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4930
She was very white because she used to live in a cold country.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4931
So they didn't tell you about our situation!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4932
So they've told you about the difficult situation!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4933
So you were told about that!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4934
He was angry because she always talks too much.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4935
He was very happy, so she wasn't worried about his anger.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4936
She thought she may have provoked his anger.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4937
I am eternally thankful.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4938
I am so happy and grateful for what you have done today.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4939
I will forever be filled with malice and hatred.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4940
He wanted revenge more than anything else in the world.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4941
He would forgo the blood due to him if his mom asked him to.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4942
He would not give up the blood he thought due to him for his daughter, mom or niece.

The Arabella came to a tiny city that was located on a barren land devoid of life.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4944
The Arabella was located just across the harbour's edge where the rest of the city was located.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4945
The city was a very popular location for trade as it was right near the water.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4946
I'm not ashamed of anything that I've done, considering the provocation I've received.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4947
I'm very ashamed of everything, I need to apologize immediately.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4948
I've done nothing at all that I am ashamed of because I was heavily provoked.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4949
Blood was the captain of a ship and Wolverstone was his best friend.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4950

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4951
Wolverstone remained quiet as he made his way away from Blood.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4952
Back then you had great fortune.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4953
In the past you were an unfortunate gentleman.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4954
You were unfortunate but now you have a better circumstance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4955
He had a beard that was a gold color.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4956
He had been growing his beard for years.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4957
His face was clean-shaven.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4958
The woman had had enough of their bad behavior.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4959
The woman was angry and defensive.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4960
The woman was so delighted that she was speechless!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4961
Captain Blood bowed silently because he was a quiet man.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4962
Captain Blood completely ignored her presence and she didn't even notice him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4963
She responded to Captain Blood's greeting in a formal and calm way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4964
There had been problems with Bishop since the landing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4965
There had been trouble with Bishop because nobody likes him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4966
There were no problems, everything was perfectly fine.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4967
Ogle had been waiting a long time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4968
Ogle was losing his patience.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4969
Ogle was peaceful and calm.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4970
I don't think Lord Julian was sententious, he was so dumb!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4971
I think Lord Julian was sententious, as he used to be.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4972
Lord Julian was sententious and wise, as I gather that he often was because of his position
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4973
I could not possibly prove to you anything at all.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4974
I could prove this because of all the evidence I had collected without your knowledge.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4975
I could prove to you the falsehoods that were present in the transactions.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4976
He did not ask any questions, since he knew he had picked the best way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4977
He wanted to know if there was a better way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4978
He was convinced that he had chosen the best way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4979
The person wanted a lover.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4980
The person was in a hurry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4981
The person was taking their time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4982
You must not look at the crisis happening at this very moment.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4983
You need to pay more attention.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4984
You really need to be aware of the emergency happening.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4985
I have no understanding of what you did or why you did it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4986
You had let the ship sink, though thought not to tell me because it would make me feel sad.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4987
You might have considered me when you did what you did.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4988
He rose promptly, and proceeded to pull Lord Julian up to his feet.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4989
He was feeling very tired, so he did not stand up.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4990
Lord Julian rose, showing good manners, but he did not bother standing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4991
I won't keep you detained any longer, ma'am.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4992
I'll not be detaining you any longer because it wouldn't be fair, ma'am.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4993
You will be detained for the rest of your life, ma'am.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4994
He let out a sign of resignation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4995
He remained silent as he complained about the simplicity of life.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4996
Life is infernally complicated because of the many interactions one might have.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4997
Colonel Bishop has done something to make Wolverstone his enemy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4998
He spit on the ground in an effort to emphasize his point.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

4999
Wolverstone and Colonel Bishop were close friends.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5000
One of the only opportunities available would be surrendering the girl.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
