3401
Actually we do not consider ourselves to be naturalists.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3402
We are totally true naturalists and are insulted to be thought of otherwise!

3424
The Black Eyed Pea is likable, I think its corporate.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3425
I have nothing that I could compare it too.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3426
Is that the same thing as match savings
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3427
Match savings would be the same thing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3444
It was very easy to notice.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3445
The design was horrible.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3446
It's hard to load up the paper, glass and can after separating them into their own container.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3447
The paper is the first to get full then cans, then glass.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3448
WSe do not separate anything, we throw it all in one bag.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3449

Far from the truth the laws are old and outdated.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3495
Indeed it is but the regulations took a long time to become a reality.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3496
Precisely, though with the new regulations it is more difficult now.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

3497
People will work if they have opportunity.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
