5001
There are plenty of alternatives to solve this problem other than to hand over the girl as a hostage.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5002
To surrender the hostage would mean certain death for her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5003
Everything is included in the bargain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5004
That is not in the bargain because it wouldn't be fair.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5005
That isn't included in the agreement.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5006
Calverly responded in a way that made him seem like he was on-the-fence about something.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5007
Calverly was only indecisive in his answer because he did not know all of the facts.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5008
Cleverly spoke with clear decisiveness, knowing that he has with certainty.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5009
He has his own officers.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5010
He is alone and has no officers.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5011
His officers respect him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5012
She did not want him to help her, though was grateful anyway.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5013
She had told him that resolve was what it took to keep her away from peril.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5014
The resolve did not protect her at all from any dangers.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5015
It is a distinguished and eminent service.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5016
It is an honorable service because it's about saving lives.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5017
It isn't an honorable service at all, it's very embarrassing!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5018
She refused to even look at him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5019
She was afraid he would kill her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5020
She was looking at him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5021
She exclaimed with delight at just the thought of it!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5022
She was trying not to think of the event that took place.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5023
Thinking about the event made her shudder.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5024
All Buccaneers in most ships are loud when yelling in unison.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5025
The Buccaneers were loud when giving a yes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5026
There was no sign of the buccaneers below as they were presumed silent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5027
The man is acting uncivilized.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5028
The man is calm and reasonable.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5029
They are having a conversation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5030
He had heard some exciting news.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5031
He was looking away from the Captain and then turned around to see him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5032
The Captain was angry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5033
He kept his eyes down looking at the ground.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5034
He was surprised by her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5035
She was braver than he expected.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5036
He sat in a chair in the cabin.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5037
He sat in a green chair in the cabin.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5038
He sat on the floor of the cabin because there weren't any chairs available.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5039
A man was killed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5040
He was killed with a sword.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5041
The man's life was spared.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5042
Colonel Bishop was angry because the captain had stolen something.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5043
The ships behind them belonged to friends.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5044
There were ships chasing after them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5045
Colonel Bishop has heard some bad news.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5046
Colonel Bishop is already cool.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5047
Colonel Bishop is heated.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5048
You are not assigned to the gun deck.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5049
You are stationed on the gun deck.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5050
You will only be stationed today on the gun deck.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5051
Pitt completely ignored what was asked of him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5052
Pitt is the name of a dog that is very obedient.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5053
Pitt quickly followed the order.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5054
He had never been to Port Royal.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5055
He spent 2 weeks in Port Royal.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5056
He was doing repairs on his ship.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5057
Her voice was loud and booming.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5058
She had heard something.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5059
She spoke quietly because she was afraid.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5060
The man was the captain of one of the ships.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5061
There was a fleet of ships.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5062
There were no ships in sight.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5063
Blood had been inside his cabin.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5064
Blood was laughing because he was joyful.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5065
Blood was scowling.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5066
He knew he would be completely safe if he went ashore.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5067
It was dangerous for him to go to shore.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5068
There were people on shore who wanted to kill him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5069
I did not dream last Friday.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5070
I did not dream.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5071
I had three dreams.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5072
I am definitely ungrateful to you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5073
I am grateful because you had done a lot for me.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5074
One is certainly grateful.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5075
He had heard her shout from afar.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5076
She shouted that there was no hope for him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5077
There was certainly still hope for him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5078
It has always been a contest ever since we went about.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5079
The race had begun ever since we were four.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5080
There was never any race to begin with.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5081
People were killed in the Spanish raid.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5082
The Spanish raid was done at night.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5083
There was never a raid on Bridgetown.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5084
Blood is a man.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5085
The seal remained unbroken.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5086
The seal was broken.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5087
Miss Bishop was alone in the garden.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5088
Miss Bishop went to the garden in order to contemplate her life.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5089
There was absolutely no one at the garden whatsoever.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5090
His lordship spoke sharply.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5091
His lordship was a mute.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5092
His lordship was angry because I had neglected my duties.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5093
He did not understand the threat that laid before him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5094
He understood very clearly, the threat that was before him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5095
The threat was vague because the area was covered in fog.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5096
Jeremey had forgotten why he was so angry.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5097
Jeremy opened his hand, revealing his palms.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5098
Jeremy tightened his fists.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5099
My way is the most difficult.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

5100
Someone else's way is difficult.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
