## Translation Instructions

Under `translation` folder, there are 100 files, each containing 100 blocks. Each block has a block number, an English sentence and a placeholder for Myanmar Translation.

For example:
```
114
We were watching something on TV.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
```

As a translator, you can pick any file and add missing translations at the tag <MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>, and keep other sentences intact. Please use only Myanmar Unicode font in your translations. You are also requested to separate Buremse phrases by spaces where it makes sense, and use ပုဒ်မ `။` as a sentence terminator.

```

ကျွန်တော်တို့ တီဗီမှာ တခုခု ကြည့်နေခဲ့သည်။
